## ENB Tips
*Feel free to make suggestions or contribute.*

### Quick Notes
- Not everything here will apply to your ENB, but hey, just trying to help. ;)
- First off, to tweak your ENB settings in-game, the key(s) to open up the UI will vary per ENB. By default, it's `SHIFT + ENTER`. If you've tried several combinations and still haven't opened up the UI, look for your enblocal.ini and edit what it says in KeyEditor.

### Tweaks

#### Why does hair look funny? 
Try to turn off/tweak `Detailed Shadow` and `Wet Surfaces`. Look for `Reflection Amount` in `Wet Surfaces`, if you decide not to turn it off.
