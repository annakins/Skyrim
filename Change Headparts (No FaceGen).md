## Before you proceed
This guide is meant for existing actors that already have a FaceGen. It's also mostly for me so I can easily remember the next time I do this. :P

## Hair
- Let's use KS Hairs as an example. 
- Open up the KSHairdos.esp in Creation Kit just to see what hairline the hair you want uses.
- Check the box for `Show only active (*) forms`. In the Filter field, look up the hair.
- Check the Extra Parts section to see if you need to change the scalp.
- Close Creation Kit.
- Copy the new hair files. 
  - KS Hairs folder > meshes > KS Hairdo's > Synthesis.nif, Synthesis.tri, SynthesisHl.nif.
  - KS Hairs folder > textures > KS Hairdo's > Synthesis.dds, Synthesis_n.dds
- Paste them into your mod's folder.
  - Follower folder > meshes > actors > character > Follower > hair
  - Follower folder > textures > actors > character > Follower > hair
